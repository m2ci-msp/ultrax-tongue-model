# Tongue Model derived from Data of the Ultrax Project

## Introduction

This repository contains a tongue model from MRI data of the [Ultrax project][1] and of [Adam Baker][2].

## Components

The assets of this repository provide you with the following files:

- tongue_model.yaml : This is the tongue model in [YAML format][4] ready to be used with the [mri-shape-tools][3].
- tongue_model.json : This is the tongue model in text-based [JSON format][5].
